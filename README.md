# ISA Easy Email

*Easily compose emails for International Studies Abroad*

Born out of the desire to have a simple, clutter-free way to compose HTML emails
for work, ISA Easy Email provides ISA employees with just that. Though they
still must use internal tools to create and send the email itself, this tool
allows ISA employees to see what they are writing as they are writing it.
Meanwhile, the writing interface provides all the editing tools one comes to
expect while being much less clunky than older rich text editors.

## Design
The application is centered around two main sections: the editor and the
controller. Of course, the editor is the main focal point here.
